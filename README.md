# 🚀 Frontend Engineer (0–1 / Fresher) — Hiring Assignment

## Welcome! 👋

This repository contains the frontend hiring assignment for 0–1 year / fresher frontend engineers at DataActions.

**This assignment is designed to evaluate how you think, not how fancy your UI is.**

## 🌍 About DataActions

DataActions is a venture-backed, Singapore-headquartered company building next-generation Decision Intelligence platforms for B2B2C SaaS companies.

We are building a semantic + AI-powered layer that helps users and agents move from **insight → decision → action**, instead of just looking at dashboards.

As a frontend engineer, you'll work close to:

- Product thinking
- UX decisions
- Real users
- Founding team

## 🎯 Purpose of This Assignment

### We are **not** testing:

- DSA
- Tricky JavaScript questions
- Pixel-perfect UI

### We **are** testing:

- Your problem-solving approach
- How you break down an unclear problem
- Code structure & clarity
- Ability to explain your decisions
- Comfort with experimenting and iterating (vibe coding 🎧)

## 🧠 Assignment Overview

You'll build a simple **Insight Widget** — a small frontend component that visualizes a metric over time.

Think of it as a mini dashboard card.

## 📌 Functional Requirements

Your app/component should:

- Allow the user to enter:
  - **Metric name** (text input)
  - **Time range** → last N days
- Display data for the selected metric and time range
- Data can be mocked / hardcoded
  - No backend required
- Visualize the data in any one form:
  - Table
  - Chart
  - List
  - Or any creative but simple format
- Update the view when inputs change

## 🛠️ Tech Guidelines

- **Framework:** React.js (preferred)
- **Language:** JavaScript or TypeScript
- **Styling:** Anything works (CSS / Tailwind / inline styles)
- **Data:** Mocked or generated locally

⚠️ **Do not over-engineer. Keep it simple.**

## 📁 Suggested Project Structure (Optional)

```
src/
 ├── components/
 │    └── InsightWidget.jsx
 ├── data/
 │    └── mockData.js
 ├── App.jsx
 └── index.js
```

You are free to structure it differently if you have a good reason.

## ✨ What We Care About Most

When we review your submission, we'll focus on:

### 1. Problem-Solving Approach

- How did you interpret the problem?
- Did you make reasonable assumptions?
- Did you keep the solution simple?

### 2. Code Quality

- Readable variable & function names
- Clear component structure
- Logical separation of concerns

### 3. Thought Process

- Why did you choose this UI?
- Why this structure?
- What trade-offs did you make?

### 4. Learning Mindset

- Are you comfortable exploring and iterating?
- Do you explain what you'd improve with more time?

## 🎥 Submission Instructions

You can submit either one of the following:

### Option 1: GitHub Repository

- Push your code to a public GitHub repo
- Include a short explanation in the README:
  - Your approach
  - Assumptions
  - Improvements you'd make

### Option 2: Loom Video (Preferred)

- 5–8 minutes max
- Explain:
  - Your thought process
  - Code walkthrough
  - Trade-offs & future improvements

👉 **UI polish is optional**  
👉 **Clear thinking is mandatory**

## 🚫 What Not To Do

- Don't copy-paste heavy chart libraries just to impress
- Don't over-abstract or build complex architecture
- Don't stress about perfect design

**This is not a trick assignment.**

## 🧪 Bonus (Optional)

If you want to go a bit extra (not required):

- Add basic input validation
- Make the widget reusable
- Add simple UX improvements

## ⏳ Time Expectation

**2–4 hours**

Please don't spend days on this.
